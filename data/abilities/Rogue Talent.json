    "shortDescription" : "As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogueâ€™s sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made. A rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue talent.",
